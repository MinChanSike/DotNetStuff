1. When a computer boots, the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) reads the disk and loads the first sector into memory at address 0x7C00.
Then BIOS jumps to address 0x0x7C00.

The machine code that was loaded from the DOS is called the "Boot Loader" and is responsible for loading the Operating System.
