ProgramName Command Line Arguments

Instead of only allowing the shell to execute programs, who have a single entry point, every program will have as many entry points as they like.  To identify a program, one can use the programs namespace.  Much like the PATH environment variables, the optimus shell will have a USING environment variables which specifies which namespaces are currently being used.  Or one could type the entire namespace.

Let's say you made a program called Sockets in the system.network namespace.  Let's also say that the Sockets program exposed the following functions:

socket, bind, connect, send, recv, close

Now let's say you want to create a socket.  You could do so from the shell like this:

system.network.socket (inputs) (outputs)
system.network.bind (inputs) (outputs)
system.network.connect (inputs) (outputs)
system.network.send (inputs) (outputs)
system.network.recv (inputs) (outputs)
system.network.close (inputs) (outputs)
